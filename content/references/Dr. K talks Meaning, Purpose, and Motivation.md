# Dr. K talks Meaning, Purpose, and Motivation
start- 24:07

Post 1: there's no purpose/dharma strong enough to overcome suffering/dukkha

- if something is true, you don't need an organization, or a torch holder, to keep it going.
	- if all current knowledge of the world was wiped away, we'd still discover gravity, the earth is round, etc.
	- if it's true, we don't need someone to perpetuate it  
- how do we learn about things like dharma and dukkha?
	- through disseminated material
		- transmute knowledge into being easily accessible
		- traditionally, these concepts weren't taught as stand alone material, but rather alongside practices
			- how do we learn how to swim? get in the water
				- reading books on it will only get you so far
	- we're learning about spirituality the way that people learn about sex through porn
- Dukkha
	- Du - "Bad" & Kha - "Space"
		- space where space does not belong - bad space
		- exs. 
			- a restaurant that's wobbly - there's a gap between one of the legs and the floor - that kind of space
			- eating a slice of pizza - feeling guilty "i should've eaten a salad"
			- boredom
			- addiction
				- "in the realm of hungry ghosts" says addiction is a way to fill the emptiness within us
- Dharma
	- Dhri - support (or constant) 
	- "as you start building a life based on constants, things will go better for you"
	- It's about harmony - to live in a harmonious way
		- [ ] investigate, what actually is harmony?
		- Greek philosophers called this Telos
			- is the object fulfilling its purpose? 
				- ex. table holding things, chair holding someone's weight
			- if yes, it makes it good and virtuous
	- back to Dharma - 
		- support = the thing that holds other things up

- relationship between dharma and dhukka
	- path to happiness has 4 steps
		- dharma - "duty"
		- artha - "wealth"
			- half of the problems of most people could be solved with money
				- we have a mental health crisis that's rooted in an economic crisis
			- security, not hungry/thirsty, etc
		- kama - "pleasure"
			- dopamine, seratonin for instance
			- enjoying coffee, vacation, having fun
		- moksha - "liberation"
	- however, each of those points only solve for a part, you need to incorporate all of them
		- either that, or arguably just moksha
		- but, a lot of people on the internet just focus on the middle two, of wealth and pleasure
	- we chase the wealth and pleasure because it partially satisfies us, but only to a certain extent

how does dharma help suffering?
- it makes suffering tolerable, or choosable
- for any decision, you have 2 options
	- a painful option
	- a pleasurable option
		- dopamine circuitry always pushes us this way
		- problem: How do I move myself forward in life if nothing feels exciting or rewarding enough to go for?
			- this question mean you're stuck in "seeking pleasure", needing to be driven by pleasure in order to do something
			- once we get conditioned to pleasure, we have so much access, that we can start developing tolerances, or numbness, to pleasure
	- we have tools that can try to push us towards the painful option when we know we should or have to
		- for instance, willpower, discipline, brain hacking, etc.
	- however, dharma lets us just choose the painful option
		- it make suffering more tolerable, or even want to pick the path of pain
	- ex. if someone points a gun at you
		- you want to avoid the gun
		- but if there's someone there that you love, you put yourself in the path of the gun to protect the other person
- in addiction psychiatry, in order to become sober, you have to have a good enough reason, called a competing interest
	- Dr.K's story about "walking your daughter down the aisle wheeling an oxygen tank"
		- information doesn't help overcome addictions
		- when you stop an addiction, its painful
- as you start to choose pleasure more and more, your life begins to feel more and more empty
	- "i'm not doing anything with my life"
- dharma doesn't reduce your suffering, it makes the suffering worthwhile

- chatgpt summary
	The essence of the notes revolves around the concepts of dukkha (suffering) and dharma (duty or moral righteousness) and their interplay in the context of human existence and spirituality. The notion is that there is no purpose or dharma robust enough to fully negate suffering. It suggests that truths, such as the fundamental aspects of physics or the shape of the Earth, do not require organizations to be sustained; they are self-evident through discovery and inquiry. This analogy extends to the understanding of dharma and dukkha, which traditionally come from experiential learning rather than formal education, much like learning to swim by getting into water rather than reading about it.
	
	Dukkha, defined as a "bad space" or discomfort, manifests in various forms, from the tangible, like a wobbly restaurant table, to the existential, such as feelings of guilt or addiction. It's highlighted that addiction is often a means to fill an internal void, an attempt to occupy the "bad space" within us.
	
	Dharma, on the other hand, is described as a principle of support or constancy, aiming for harmony in living. It's akin to the Greek concept of Telos, the fulfillment of purpose or function that defines goodness and virtue. The path to happiness is outlined in four steps: dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (pleasure), and moksha (liberation), with each addressing different facets of life's challenges. However, true satisfaction requires a holistic incorporation of these elements, with a significant emphasis on moksha for ultimate liberation.
	
	Dharma's role in addressing suffering is not to eliminate it but to make it a conscious choice, more bearable, or even desirable under certain circumstances. This choice often comes down to selecting between a painful option, which might be morally right or beneficial in the long term, and a pleasurable one, which is immediately gratifying but potentially harmful over time. The concept argues that while human nature tends to veer towards pleasure, an overemphasis on it can lead to a numbing of joy and a sense of emptiness. Dharma, through moral and ethical discipline, allows individuals to choose paths that are not solely based on immediate gratification but on long-term fulfillment and righteousness. This approach does not reduce suffering but makes it meaningful and worth experiencing, especially when aligned with higher purposes or duties that extend beyond personal gain or pleasure.

How to find purpose?

- dharma is not a big, broad purpose
	- we have an idea that dharma is a grand sacrificing, living for something grandiose, life purpose, but its not
	- dharma means "suport" or "constant"
	- instead, it's about increasing harmony
		- going back to the table leg example, the space between the leg and the floor is a disharmony
- you already know what you need to do to increase the harmony of your life
- if you're not living in accordance with dharma, there will be disharmony, space created around you, friction
- when you wake up, do things feel fluid and easy?
	- or, is everything a friction?
- Capital D-Dharma is ego gratifying
	- if you're a little shit person, you have to accomplish something very big
	- ex. DrK talks about how when he was failing out of school, he had ambitions to go to harvard
		- but actually, when he let that goal go, "i'm a loser, i'm going to do the best i can in life, maybe after 3 years of applying to med school, maybe i'll  get a chance to become a doctor"
	- give up on your big dreams
		- big dreams sabotage your ability to work
		- there's a part of our brain that deals with motivation - PFC & NAcc
			- nucleus accumbens is source of motivation
			- PFC is in charge of value generation
				- assesses the value of an action
					- if value generation is favorable, it'll motivate you to go do it
				- ex. "what percentage of going to spanish class this morning will help me with the lofty goal of getting into harvard med?"
					- PFC says "basically insignificant, its not worth it, we're not going to do it"
			- "if you're stuck in life, doing the same, time-wasting activities, I will bet you money that wehn you try to do something else your mind tells you it is not worth it, it is not enough"
				- where does 'enough' come from?
					- the ratio of today's action to your goal
					- the bigger your dreams, the less 'enough' a given task will be
	- when you stop focusing on those big goals, or moreso how people percieve you as having those big goals,  you get to start focusing on the work
- dharma is not about the big Purpose, its about creating harmony between you and the life around you
	- emptying the trash can
	- adding a serving of fruit or veg
	- being a slightly nicer, slightly good

how to find your dharma
1. take care of yourself
	- you, and only you are responsible for your body
	- start with a 1 hour walk
	- eat healthier
2. stop externalizing your attention
	- the more time we spend externalizing our attention, "our mind is not with us anymore"
		- in order to be efficient, we're listening to a podcast, watching a video, etc. while we're doing something else
		- constant externalization of attention, in the guise of productivity
	- as you spend more time outside yourself, you lose your connectino with yourself
		- as this happens, you wake up, and ask yourself "what should i do?"
			- we can get the answer from one of two places
				- inside
				- outside
					- the more you look here, the more friction you create
						- "you should be this, here's how to do this"
						- there's always going to be a discrepancy between what the world tells you and what you actually want
					- as you externalize, the internal mind gets pilled up with crap
						- procastination -> guilt -> feeling behind -> insecurity 
						- as you feel worse about yourself, spending time with yourself become difficult
							- you become a cesspool
						- we have technology that surpesses the amygdyla and limbic system
							- so, when you feel bad, it'll cover up all of that stuff that you feel worse about
						- so we feel awful about ourselves on the inside, then we turn to the outside and ask how to fix it
							- then we turn to gurus and motivational people, or products that are meant to change our image
								- and they all pull in different directions
									- try an instrument, try painting, saving up for a surgery
									- and even if you do check all of these boxes, it ends up not being enough - insufficient
							- we have no internal compass, it leads to an adharmic lifestyle 
								- any given day, doing something random that we think is the right thing to do 
							- everything about you is unique, so how are you going to find an answer from a guru on the internet?
		- boredom - what is it?
			- just existing with yourself, nothing external to occupy your mind
	- how do you implement this?
		- instrospect - spend more time with yourself
			- the world can't tell you what you want
		- take care of your body
		- go for walkies

your dharma is waiting for you
- dr.k is 100% confident in, but isn't scientifically validated
- you don't get your Dharma until your dharma (above) is met
	- you can't progress to the main quest until you finish tutorial island
	- when you are ready, things will happen
- "are you going to act in accordance with your hopes, or something else?"
	- doing something regardless if your PFC thinks it's energy efficient, possibly worth the effort it takes, possible ROI
- "if you don't do this thing, who else is going to do it?"
	- if the answer is no one, that's your dharma
- Dharmas are much more difficult, if you're not able to do the smaller dharmas, would you even be able to handle it right now?
	- the weight that you have to carry grows and grows
	- you have to decide, will you carry it 
- you know what your dharma is, you just don't want to do it
	- but we want the grandiose, big purpose Dharma
	- but your PFC comes in and says "that's not enough"
		- have to watch out for when your mind devalues something
	- if your nuccleus accumbens is like "i don't want to do this", then your PFC comes around and says "its not enough" 
		- now you have a rational explanation of why cleaning your room or meditating is never going to be enough
	- the mind thinks it understands "i tried it, it doesn't work for me"
- your dharma is hard to get to because wej don't eintrospect enough because we call introspection brodem
	- be with yourself for a while. see what happens. connect to your internal self
	- it'll tell you what you should be doing
- life is an interaction between stuff
	- when you operate in line with the interaction, your life is harmonious
	- when you operate with friction, your life is not harmonious
	- ex. 
		- a jacket creates harmony between you and your environment
		- does doing this person's request increase the harmony in my life?

whats the difference between friction and healthy challenges?
- what happens to your harmony at the end?
- ex. accepting someone who is toxic
	- what does my life look like in the next 10 years if i bring this person into my life
		- if it reduces your harmony, move away from it
- dharma allows you to embrace the pain for the sake of something greater
- should you take care of your body? yes because you're the only one who cando that
- look at the things that only you can take care of, and those are the things that you can take care of
	- they're going to be hard, do it anyway
		- "but its hard" yeah. you have to start somewhere
- the mind looks for something complex
	- drk says take a walk, eat healthier, exercise, socialize, little pleasure, get money & security
		- but we want the roadmap to find a big purpose
			- then, those smaller things he rcommends become so small in the grand scheme, PFC says that they end up not being worth it
- as you start to take steps in the right direction and you introspect, you need to listen to yourself,
	- the rest of the world will tell you what to do, but they don't know you
	- do something, take care of yourself, then the rest of the stuff will come
		- and help will show up along the way

when your mind says "i'm going to be stuck for ever, it won't be enough, this won't work"
- what is the end result? means you don't have to eat healthy today
- any kind of conclusion your mind comes to, you have to ask "what is the direction that my mind wants me to go"
	- 90% of the time, your mind is telling you things to craft the life it wants, not that you want
		- unless it is trained. you have to be control over it
		- who is responsible for conditioning your mind?
			- *the world*  - and they love doing it. because if they can control your mind, it can control your actions. its why advertising is a thing.


Post 2: i know what i should do, but nothing compels me to want to do it
- simple - do your wants control your life?
	- everyone wants motivation - because they are lazy
		- motivation is a natural inclination to move in a particular direction
			- you don't need to push yourself
		- so the more lazy you are, the more motivation you want, you don't want to put effort in, you want your body to just do it by itself
		- "i hope i wake up motivated" because i don't have any control ovder myself
- do you want to live a life where. you're directed by your wants, or not directed by your wants?
	- does your desire control you or do you control your desire
- the mind will convince you that things won't be worth it, that theyre not exciting or fulfilling
- what to actually do about it
	- control your mind
		- meditation is #1
			- meditation is all about controlling your mind - your mind wanders and you reel it back in
			- as you meditate more, your actions become independent of your wants
				- we're trying to cultivate a particular want, but we're not in control of it
					- when you say jump, the mind should jump
		- don't take your phone to the bathroom, don't take anything with you on your next flight
	- if you don't want to do somehting that you should do
		 - learn to not let your wants control you
			 - just learn to be bored - #2
			 - "i want this" 'so what'
	- tolerance of boredom is #2
		- get good at being bored
		- eventually, your mind will come crawling to you "please give me something to do"
			- and you can be like, "cool, do the task we have scheduled"

moksha & meditation - 
- first phase of unhappiness in life 
	- the mind seeks particular things that it thinks will make it happy
		- and it does for a short time
		- but its never enough
	- it is the nature of a want to be temporary, and the satisfaction of that want to be temporary too
	- this is all about kama aka pleasure
- stage 2
	- security - i need to support the life that i live
	- need that need to be met
	- artha - wealth
		- protects us against the negative things in life and moves us towards kama
- stage 3 
	- dharma
	- be on the earth for something, greater than yourself, greater purpose to life
- you do all of the above, and then what?
- "to understand moksha and the real purpose of life, we have to understand the bounds of different dimensions of self"
	- evolution - which part is subject to evolution? - primarily the physical body
		- hunger, thirst, etc
		- ex. like a bacterium - its physcially driven
	- but we are more than just that - we have layers of self that transcend the physical - the *mind*
		- friends, accomplishments, emotions, but those still don't fill in the whole pictures
		- animals, dogs for instance, seem to be satisfied by all of the above, 
	- so what's the difference between us and animals?
		- humans have a higher degree of awareness
			- this is sort of in line with Stumbling On Happiness
			- what actually is awareness?
				- "that which experiences everything else"
		- "the essence of you"
			- your body changes over time, but it'll always be you
			- the mind changes, happy one day, sad the next, you are that which experiences that
	- if there's only a physical dimension and a mental dimension, then fulfilling these things would make us content
		- *I'm not too sure what i think of this, since couldn't you classify the whole fulfilment thing within mental? Or he might be talking more of a consciousness, spiritual thing where we don't have an understanding of how our neurons firing turn into thought and conciousness. Also, I think a lot of the emotional thing is hardwired in, we can see the physicality of it, so I wonder if I'd argue what Dr.k is talking about body & mind is actually just body*
		- "I have everything, why am I not happy yet?"
			- now we get to moksha
- moksha - liberation
	- you can exist outside of a sensation of body and outside a sensation of mind
		- you can trigger an out of body experience by electrically stimulating temporo-poriteo junction
	- meditation is one of the paths to do it
		- looking at attention - how to experience pure concioussness
			- pratyahara
				- if you close your eyes, the awareness used by the eyes get moved to the other senses
				- whatever sense you get rid of, the attention moves to the other senses
				- what if you get rid of every sense?
					- goes to the mind, but then, thoughts can cease too
			- dharna
				- focusing attention on a single thing
				- ex. fixed point gazing - trataka
			- nyan
				- the mind will acclimitize to a stimulus
			- we push everything else to the side and focuses on one thing
				- but eventually, everything runs out, we acclimatize to everything
			- this is path 1 to meditation - all you are is attention without an object of focus
				- feels cool, blissful
				- you won't experience duhk - suffering during this
			- if you're filled with discontent, this is the food to that hunger
		- this isn't an 8 week thing - its a 3-20 year thing
			- moksha moves slowly, with very little gain along the way
			- when the mind expects a gain, that's when you run into problems - why it's difficult to be disciplined
				- *dopamine - expecting a reward for your actions. when you dont get a reward, you have dopamine reward prediction error and it feels mucho bad, actively discourages you from continuing the activity.* if it does get the reward, it'll want more next time
				- "how many times do i have to buy this person flowers to get them to like me"
				- "when do i get what i want"
			- if there is an expected gain, mind enters the picture
				- if you're meditating for something, your mind will want to get it, then once it does, it'll be satisfied
			- to get rid of mind, you have to operate on a scale in which the mind is gone
				- doing something for no point, over and over and over again, and that is when you'll discover
			- if you're meditating for transcendence
				- the first time is the easiest - no expectations of the mind
				- the second is the hardest - the mind comes in - "that was so cool, lets do it again"
					- when the mind becomes active from the expectations, then you can't transcend it
- a practice to be done for a decade - twice a day for 20 minutes
	- ohm chanting
	- fully open mouth to fully closed mouth, exhaling through that

2:18:00 - 2:28:00 Dr.K gives the roadmap of ohm chanting 


do we have proof of the existance of thought?
- no convincing answer that the answer is yes
- we have implications of it, but no proof
	- ex. eeg, fmri, pet scan
		- then we correlate them with thought - "what are you thinking, what are you feeling?"
		- there's activity in the amygdyla, what are you feeling? fear - that's how we know that it comes from there
- but, there's a subjectivity that cannot be measured in  the physical form
	- science has no way to measure thought
- hard biologists say that thoughts don't exist - physically
- once science failed to detect thought, we developed instruments in the physical dimension, 
- but we stopped exploring thought
	- what about the subjective experience? 
	- we can't explore that physically, objectively, and scientifically
	- what happens if you start exploring it?
		- you have to be the one that explores it, a scientist can't do it for you
		- you can apply the scientific method to internal, subjective experiences
		- this is what happens in meditation
		- moksha is about operating at this level

- what is moksha? what is the point of, or the meaning of life?
	- it doesn't have meaning
	- finding meaning of life is only a problem if you're operating in the mind
		- "what am i doing??"
		- what happened if you only existed for a day?
			- life just *is*
			- meaning is something the human mind attaches to it
				- the mind needs meaning
			- meaning is looking at a cloud and seeing its a dog
		- we're so fixated on operating within the mind because all of the technology we have is focused on that aspect
			- measuring the dopamine, seratonin, reason, logic, etc.
		- but there's a layer that is outside of mind
			- just pure conciousness - attention
				- when you start exploring this, you'll become content
					- leads to sukh - annan - moksha
				- this is the truest form of reality, everything else is less real
					- then you're done with the cycle of liberation & stuff like that
	- people that meditate are more content with their life

1 question - what are you willing to try to experience it?
- its a long journey - not 8 weeks, not 8 months, but 20 years
- there are people that commit all in
	- specific diets, cultivating specifc gut microbiome, no psychoactive substances in order to get the state 
		- avoiding tomatoes, eggplant, garlic, onions, feel sushumna less easily
	- like body building without eating the protein requirement

why should I?
 - do you want to experience the ultimate reality?
 - do you want to let your wants to control what you do 
	 - true value
	 - make a commitment, then start to follow along
	 - makes everything else easier
	- what will your willpower have to become in order to meditate for the next 7 years without any benefit?


"should i do a different meditation?"
- mind looking for the optimal
- why?
- what if one is better?
- what is better?
- get me there in 8 years instead of 10
- still giving into the mind
	- efiiciency
	- optimization
	- least amount of effort for most amount of gain
	- great for the material world


once you start meditating - pay attention to the signs
- people will come out willing to help, you should accept and keep an eye out

there are hundreds, thousands, if not millions of paths - you don't have to just chant ohm
- ohm is just the simplest
