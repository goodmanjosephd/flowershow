# Dr.K Tantra Meditation Lecture

## History
- the rishis developed tantras
	- rishi - means seer

- we have the material world
	- what we can feel, etc. with our senses
	- we developed technology - ex. microscopes and telescopes to see things we normaly cant
	- then, we were able to see through the human body
		- we developed x-rays
		- then, IV contrast
- and we have the non-material world
	- ex. a thought
		- science can't dig in deeper here yet, so...
	- the rshis did the same thing as above, they developed technology to see further into the non-material world
		- developed the telescope, microscope, etc. for the human mind

the rshis discovered that there's 3 things reality is made up of
1. conciousness
	- (shiva or brahman)
	- cosmic conciousness
	- when a small amount of conciousness coalesces, it creates a large amount of energy (C=Ep^2)
2. energy
	- (shakti or prana)
	- potential, kinetic energy, etc.
	- when a small amount of conciousness energy, it creates a large amount of matter (E=mc^2)
	- when you work at the level of energy, you can affect a lot of matter
		- look at breaking chemical bonds, or nuclear devices
1. matter
	- (anu)
	- things like atoms
	- this is where we normally operate

example: 2 people have a goal to get an A in the class
- if they have the same IQ, same goal, etc
- when it comes to manifestation, one person could get an A and the other will not
	- you can say physical resources - access to textbook, time, etc, but that might not explain everything
- there's some variable on the layer of conciousness that separates the two
	- the rshis found that there's a "source code" to the universe
		- by editing the things at this level, we can create energetic and physical manifestations
- Dr.K was given a mantra, chanted it for 5 years, and became a statistical outlier, getting into med school and practicing at harvard
	- he attributes this to chanting the mantra
	- everything else was the same. the only thing that changed was this

if you act at the level of conciousness, it will cascade down to the material world
- tantra is the process of understanding what in the material world correlates with what in the true nature of reality
- and then harnessing those

ex.
- with  technology, there's some place you can go,  type a couple keystrokes, and wipe out an entire city with a nuclear bomb
	- unless you understand the tech involved, this seems like utter magic/craziness
- dealing with waterborne illnesses in Africa
	- a professor went over, and realized their water well was being infected by the nearby latrine
	- "sometimes people just get sick"
	- guy went over and said you need to put a cemented well in and not let ground water go in
		- Why? You won't get sick. 
		- Why? Because of micro-organisms
		- Cool, show me. I can't
		- How do you know? There's an instrument called a microscope
	- this is where we are with tantra

the rishis found the right formulas, peices, etc. to put together in order to create certain effects

there are two things that are necessary
- 


## Core Principles

### 1.for anything to exist in the universe, it must have shiva and shakti
- shakti = energy and shiva = conciousness
- any time you struggle, there will be a defecit in one of those things
	- what is struggle?
		- trying to manifest something - ex. getting more fit, getting a grade, making money
	- failure to manifest is one of two things
		- lack of conciousness, will or intent
			- ex. serial failed entreprenuers, tons of energy, but hopping from project to projext
		- lack of energy
			- ex. people who have lots of ideas, but no energy or action behind it
- any tantric practice you do will improve your relationship to these two
	- your energy and your will will become bound as a side effect to tantra practice
	- you're connecting to the two, and there will be manifestation
- there must be a concept, and energy or material in order to manifest something


## Tools
- tantra comes from the root words
	- tanoti - expansion
	- trayati - liberation
	- also means "technique"
- these are spiritual techniques to harness energies of existence and manifest
	- yoga/buddhism is very different, focused on absolving our desires, breaking the cycle of birth and death
	- whereas tantra is about harness energies to create what you want
		- wealth, power, spirtual strength

basic tools
- mantra
	- a chant, vibration, or syllables that are stringed together
	- ex. a magic spell
	- there are 12 beej mantras
		- fundamental building blocks of the universe
		- there are some transcendant qualities or essences to existence
			- this is something you have to experience, isn't the most logical to explain
			- 1st quality of existence - it exists
				- there's a unit of "is"-ness of being, existence
				- when its manifested in sound, its ohm
				- the fundamental oscillation of the universe
				- ex. love is an essence, but is manifested in various ways
					- "love" the letters
					- a family relationship
					- a romantic relationship
					- when my animal sits on my lap
					- a poem
				- the transcendant concept of existance as a quality, is ohm
					- fundemental oscillation 
					- there's this unmanifest thing called conciousness that vibrates at certain frequencies 
					- ohm manifests existence
			- another ex.
				- duality of things
				- pay attention to breath - the sound of breath
				- can go to an ocean and you'll hear the same sound in your breath
				- as you look at other things, you'll hear it in the wind, etc.
				- discovered duality - fundemental attribute of the universe,
					- inhale, exhale,
					- up, down
					- hot cold
					- positive, negative
			- 12 fundemental qualities that make up the universe
				- fusion, transformation, etc.
		- as you put together these mantras in certain ways, you will activate energies of the universe and make a particular manifestation
	- mantra is on the level of sound and vibration
		- ex. mantra/vibration is a form, like a guitar
			- music requires a certain amount of form, but also requires a certain amount of energy to put into it
		- 
- yantra
	- this is the "form", physical manifestation of an abstract "essence"
	- arrangement of materials, depth, etc.
- tantra/yagna
	- complex rituals
	- fires, deities, rituals, etc.

they developed these tools for us to use, they designed the technology
- its hard for us to make a cell phone
	- but if someone makes it and give it to us, we just use it!
