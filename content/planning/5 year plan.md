1. for each of the items in the list, put a number by the item, that corresponds to the timeframe for the dream, in numbers of years (1, 3, 5 or 10)
    
2. look through your list of all the things you want to learn, be, see, do, become etc, and decide on 3-5 things you want to set as your “Goals” for 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years. Ideally there would be a balance here amongst work / health / relationships.
