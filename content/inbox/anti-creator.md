# anti-creator
- name ideas
	- hobbyist creators

- intro
- the problem
	- "look at my stripe account, you can have this too if you just buy my course"
	- the incentives of creators
		- people in the creator economy are incentivized to get your attention, your clicks, and your money, in order to keep sustaining their business
			- it leads to best practices, tactics, hacks, and unfulfilled promises of a better life
			- keep you on that drip supply of content - "maybe the next one will be the one that finally helps me"
- the solution
	- two types of anti-creators
		- 1. the people who care about the craft of creating
		- 2. the people who care about the selfish benefits of creating
	- builders, writers, artisans, craftspeople. or, just being selfish
		- is art inherently selfish
	- being an anti-creator isn't about not making things, but rather going against the common content creator perception
- taking action
	- website
	- discord



- there's been a disconnect in my head around content publishing.
	- a world of publishing content because you said you were going to publish content, vs 

Anti-creators
- Dedicated to creating content, mostly for themselves
- only publishing high quality, but not restrictive on perfectionism - not focused on monetization through courses, Monetization is an after thought,
- focused on creating content for two main reasons 
	- Clarify your own thoughts-becoming a better thinker
		- Seneca said "Qui docet discit" - he who teaches learns
	- positively contributing to your field/the internet through content
- inherently anti-niche and more self-focused - making it the ultimate niche of one
- anti growth, leading to growth - focus on quality and not attention
- focus on content around reflection. not roadmaps & cheap clickbait 
	- "how I" not "how to"
- intrinsically motivated content creation
- "the people we learn from best are often the ones who are just a step ahead of us in the journey"
	- "You don't need to be a guru. You can just be a guide."
	- "Seeing people similar to oneself succeed by sustained effort raises observers' beliefs that they too possess the capabilities to master comparable activities to succeed." 
	Seeing others perform
threatening activities without adverse con-
sequences can generate expectations in ob-
servers that they too will improve if they
intensify and persist in their efforts.

- Bandura
		- This is why you should be 
 
How to monetize?
- taking money from businesses, not consumers
	- ads & affiliates
- non content products 
	- no courses
- Direct contribution 
	- is pay walled content okay? 
	- maybe matuschak model
	- increased access
- 1000 true fans
	- $100 of products each year = 100k yearly revenue

Anticreators.com and r/anticreators are available

So sick of the cringe webinars that don't give you any information, but end up telling you that the real Stuff is in the course 

A rejection of best practices and a focus on what's necessitated out of the problem

Anti tips - no more of the "5 tips to succeeding in your career" 

Examples: 
- Julian Shapiro 
- Derek Savers "slow Content"
- https://accordingtoandrea.com - just sharing her own tips on her blog
- Sol Orwell 

Inspirations:

- how to manage creation with privacy
	- most people start with the channel
		- what's the best way, best practices on twitter, substack, etc
	- start with "what do i have to say that people care about"
		- "what am i uniquely positioned to talk about"
		- you can say it well
		- the way that you say it is going to appeal to a non-trivial group of people
	- once that clicks, then you can care more about the strategies of channel use.
		- but not having a foundation in a message or topic that people care about, those strategies are going to be meaningless, like adding schema on a page that's iframed in
	- cal calls this pull towards tractable strategies like channel optimizations "checklist productivity"
		- systems or schemes that are checklist based
	- care about having something to say that people care about, not checklist channel optimizations
	- choose a couple of reasonable channels to focus on, then re-analyze when you've gotten some traction

- **what** do you have to say that people care about? (message)
- **how** good is it? (quality)
- **why** are you uniquely positioned to say it? (authority)
- **who** is it going to appeal to? (audience)
- **where** will your content live? (channel)
- **when** will you dedicate time for creation? (effort)

[River Kenna on X: "Does anyone have a feasible model lying around where writers and artists and such can profit from their work and live well, And also where information can be free and the written word is free to go where it wishes?" / X](https://twitter.com/the_wilderless/status/1705158602242097190)
- maybe i could have a landing page that talks about all of the rest of the stuff i've written up, and this is like a "next up, sign up to the newsletter to get notified about this"
https://youtu.be/WzsPAmeDykw - How I'm learning to think clearly
- the problem
	- unfocused thoughts, spat out ideas, etc.
		- when a golden idea did come up, can only communicate 25% of the idea
	- outside of that, frustration with inability to follow a single line of thought
		- getting distracted with rabbit holes, etc
		- feels like each new piece of info just fogs things up further
- 1. "mind curse of bite sized media"
	- content is becoming shorter - shorts, tiktok, reels, twitter
		- digestible, watered down, palatable information
			- links into what cal newport was saying in the video above
			- the watered down, palatable thing is interesting too
				- the more specific your content is, the more helpful it is
	- trains you to only be able to handle content, ie information, in small quantities
		- used to filling any gaps with shortform content
	- "since most of what we consume is the end conclusions of someone elses thoughts, life, research, expereinces, we are not guided through the steps they had to go through to defend them"
		- leads you to know a lot of arguments, but not an ability to deeply understand or back them
	- "we hastily adopt opinions instead of evaluating them"
		- adopting thoughts will only let you defend the basic conclusion, not deeply understand or be able to defend it 
- 3. "info input is massively disproportionate to info output"
	- see [[Stop consuming so much content]]
	- information overload is a problem, we need a system to parse through itx act https://youtu.be/WzsPAmeDykw?t=620

How serious should the discord be? Could make it paid, but would that be counter to the main point of the community? Or could get inspiration from Alcoholics Anonymous

- anti-creator guidelines
	- don't follow the guidelines (if you don't want to )
		- of the anti-creator definition, or of any definition for that matter
	- the niche is you
	- no publishing cadence, only publishing when you have something today
		- instead, replace this with a creation habit. ex. writing every day instead of publishing everyday
	- anti-perfectionist
		- put something out there regardless if you think it's perfect. you can adapt later

What to share?
- The things that excite you
