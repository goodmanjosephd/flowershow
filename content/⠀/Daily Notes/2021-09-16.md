## Journal
Good morning! Starting late today, even though I woke up at a decent time. I'd really like to get better with my morning routine. Figure out how I can start waking up a tad earlier. If I could wake up at 630, have a half hour or so before ang wakes up to meditate and journal, then spend the rest of the morning before work writing, researching, and doing business stuff, that'd be awesome.

Other than that, I've started to get back on the horse when it comes to my habits, and I'm very proud of that! 

I've started to think more about my newsletter idea. I think one of the better ideas I have is exploring different scholarly articles each week as they relate to self development. Effortless productivity from Psychology, neuroscience, and spirituality. What would it look like if taking action were easy? I could dive into each of the topics I have, what things that I've read have to say, what some other sources are, and a bit of science/research to back things up. Before starting that I'd need to have a bit of a better process for finding and processing research articles though. And it'd probably be useful to have them as a separate tag in obsidian.
