## Journal
Good morning! I've still been having a rough week, but this morning I"m feeling a bit better. I'm almost feeling motivated to get out of whatever the hell this is. Before I was just sulking in the emotions, but now I think I kind of have the drive to change it.

Anyways, this morning I wanted to go through my goals and really get clarity on what it is I want to achieve. I know there's two parts, my research and my business. 

The research is something that I'm more heavily commited to. Always thinking about and working on daily. Though I've sort of lost sight on the action steps I need to take.

On the business side of things, I've been spending a lot of time learning trading recently. It's a difficult situation because I'm trying to figure out if I'm into it because I just want to get rich fast, or if it's something I genuinely enjoy.
