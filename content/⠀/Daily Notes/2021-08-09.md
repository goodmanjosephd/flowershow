## Journal
Good morning Journal! I'ts 730, I wok up before my alarm today, so I'm feeling good. Yesterday I journaled a bit and read a bit. I did a sort of weekly review yesterday, just reflecting on what I achieved this past week and how I can improve this week. I don't need to be perfect, I just want to get 1% better. 

I'd like to do some more work on my research question. Maybe I can try to process just one note a day or something like that. I think it'd also be cool to have a list of things that I want to work on, just like next action steps, so that way I can pull in daily highlights for the things I want to work on. Ex. like setting up the balance brewer store, or something like that! I don't have the ipad on me right now so I can't exactly remember what else I said I could improve upon. Though I think getting a list of daily highlights together would help move me a bit closer to getting 1% better!

I'm honestly super excited for whats to come!
