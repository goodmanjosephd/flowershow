## Journal
Good morning! I published my newsletter yesterday! Actually pretty proud of it, I think it's a good balance between things people can take action on, and general information. Though I think it'd be neat to include more science in the future. I have all of those notes on dopamine, so I'll be working through those :) 

I have a bunch of stuff I need to do on the Nocturne coffee side, I've just been so obsessed with trading stocks that I haven't made time for it. 

There's two conflicting sides to me. There's part of me that just wants to stick with what I started and forget about trading, but there's also a big part of me that just wants to let myself run free. I'm 22 and don't have too many commitments. I ccan try different things out as I wish!
