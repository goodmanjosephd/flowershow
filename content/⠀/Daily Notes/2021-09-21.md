## Journal
Good morning! I've been feeling a bit off still recently. Almost feel like I haven't been doing enough. I feel sad that I don't have more time each day to work on the things that I want to. There's so much that I want to learn, research, work on, but it's difficult given the amount of time in a day. I have the two main projects too, so it's even more difficult to really spend that time on both. Almost makes me wonder if it's the right choice, and if I should double down on the whole effortless productivity thing. Though I'll always wonder. I always wonder if I would've been able to make it big with the whole coffee thing. I'll give it a try while I'm working on understanding the road forward, and then if I spend all of my money and fail, then I'll consider it a loss and move onto the next thing
