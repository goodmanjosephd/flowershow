## Journal
Good morning! Don't have the most clarity today, same with yesterday. I woke up a bit late and didn't get started right away, so I don't feel the best about that. I've got a ton to do at work today, so I'm just not feeling too great in general. I'm very ready for the weekend, and hope that I'm able to get some things done today. I'll probably end up starting work at 830 today just so I can get a head start on things, maybe after I have some coffee! Everything is going to be okay! 

I'm trying to think of a name for my coffee store. I think I'm going to try to see if I can make the balance brewer happen, but if not, I'll just fall back to the general coffee store. 

I'm very scatter brained right now haha. I have so many thoughts but yet I'm tired at the same time
