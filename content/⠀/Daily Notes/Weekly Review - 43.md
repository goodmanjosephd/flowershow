Last week I wasn't very motivated. I had a few days where I didn't get very much done.

+
- shipped newsletter
- didmy habits everyday

-
- broke 3 week nofap streak (fairly intentionally)
- spent 3hours 21 minutes on my phone on average
	- almost 5hrs total on twitter

->
- more time for reflection, less time consuming
