    - 08:05 Good morning! Ang is working today, I spent a lot of time making breakfast, so didn't get as much time to work on journaling or anything like that
    - 09:03 Haven't worked yet today, have been messing around with Roam a lot!
    - 09:39 Finally going to stop messing around and start working. Wowza I feel like I'm going a million miles an hour. First time having caffeine in a while haha
