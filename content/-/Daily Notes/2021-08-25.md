## Journal
You don't need to know where you're going. You just need to start moving. 

We like to spend time setting high goals that we believe will motivate us. However, when we fail to achieve them, we start a losing streak. Plus, we don't know what we're going to be interested in 5 years from now.

Some people need the big 5 year goal to keep them moving. For others, it's too constricting.

You can make progress without it needing to contribute to a massive goal.

I have no idea what I'm doing with my personal brand. I have no 5 year goal. But I'm showing up and writing every day. I'm building my writing muscle.
