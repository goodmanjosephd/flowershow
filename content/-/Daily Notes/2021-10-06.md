## Journal
Good morning! I got so into my newsletter that I forgot to Journal! 

Sometimes I have these (what I think) are good ideas, but then totally forget them. Ex I had some thoughts on different things Journaling could be good for, like an extra 2-3 things, but now I totally forgot. same with last night, I think I had an idea for what could go at the end of my newsletter, but I have no idea.

Really focused on getting this newsletter done, may journal more later though :)

## Notes
How to get motivated
- When you don't feel like doing something, start with putting away all distractions. focus on taking a bit of time for yourself
- Sit with yourself and reflect
	- what would the perfect version of myself be doing? what would they be feeling? why do they feel that way? What thoughts do they have? What's motivating them about the task that they're doing?
	- What are they working on? What's the very first step that they took.
