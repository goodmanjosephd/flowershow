        - Good morning! Weird start to the day. I feel bad that I wasn't more productive this morning, that I didn't journal or meditate, that I just kind of dicked around, so now it's 830 and I don't have anything done :( It's days like these that start off on the wrong foot that really throw me off. I'd really like to be better about my mornings but it's just been really difficult for me. Maybe if I negotiate and start trying to wake up at like 7:30, get a glass of water, and journal for 15 minutes, then that'd be better
