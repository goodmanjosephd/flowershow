- Journal
    - Good morning! I definitely need to get my morning routine in a better spot, I woke up at 7ish, but then spent a lot of time dicking around, not doing the things that I got up early to do until 5 minutes before work haha. That's okay though. I'm proud of myself for getting up early!
    - I really want to get control of my work. If I can get ahead (rather on-time) this week, then I could be a bit more disciplined with my time, and spend some of my time during the day working on other things! Such as blogging or working on a business idea.

    - Failure
        - When we set high goals for ourselves, and then constantly fail, we subconciously understand that we can't do them. Our feeling brain knows that we're a failure. We may think that we can do it, but our brain knows really that we'd just fail.
        - then, in order to conserve energy, our brain says "why even try" says, "I don't feel like it" and your thinking brain interprets it as "I have no motivation"
        - So you should lower the bar!
