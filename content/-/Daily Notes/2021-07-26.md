Good morning! 

I've been struggling with figuring out what it is that I want to do. I feel guilty that I haven't really set firm goals and have a plan of action and everything. I've been spending a lot of time on redesigning my blog, which I think looks pretty good with what I've sone so far, but I still have a lot to do. I need to work on the blog post page it self now. 

I want to get back into journaling more, and I want to start meditating as well.
