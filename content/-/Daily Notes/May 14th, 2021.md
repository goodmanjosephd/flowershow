        - Hi there! It's not really morning right now but it's better that I do this in the early afternoon rather than never at all! Yesterday got very busy. I wanted to do more journalling but ended up havcing a lot of work to do, which is totally okay. I've been feeling not the best about work recently so being able to just focus in and really get stuff done was pretty great.
        - On the topic of work, I've been thinking a lot about my job and side hustles, how to go about it all. It's honestly really really difficult. Like honestly, one of the most difficulkt thinks I'll have to do in my professional life. Getting into college, doing college, getting a job, all of that stuff was freaking easy compared to this. I'm readu for the challenge. I'm ready to do the thing that not a lot of people can do and take the leap. 
        - Right now, the highest opportunity and exiting thing is doing stuff around the notion api. If Jake is willing to help out and create integrations, I can do the marketing
