        - Hi! It's been a hot second.
        - I wanted to do some journaling around stuff with work. I have a bunch of stuff that I need to get done but I haven't really taken any time to take a step back and get clarity. I'd like to make some progress on the goals stuff, but I think I haven't really known where to start. There's so many different things that I want to build, automate, create, tons of things I want to help out with, so how do I get started?
        - I think that's exactly what I need to do. I need to get clear on priorities and how I can help. I think that'd be great to do with the Notion Goals page.
