## Journal
Good morning! Recently I've bee feeling pretty anxious. I'm not 100% sure why. I don't have a lot of experience nailing down my emotions that way. One aspect could definitely be having to run the HT meeting today. Another could be a lack in confidence of myself to hit the sort of expectations I've set for myself for my newsletter. Another could be that I'm not happy with my work performace over the past couple of days. It sucks because I wanted to journal about it to figure what was wrong, but then in bringing it up I think I started to feel it again haha. 

I dunno. I think with the newsletter thing I just need to focus on shipping for the first 4 weeks. Just get something out the door, no matter what it is.
