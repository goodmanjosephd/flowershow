## Journal
Hi there! Journaling a little bit later at night tonight. I've been feeling on and off today, I've been feeling not so great because of the emotional rut I've been in lately, but I've also been thinking about what it is that I want to work on and pursue. 

I've been struggling with the want to start day tradgin, I thin it's something that's pretty cool, something I've always been interested in, and I think it'd be awesome to have that lifestyle. But the part is, is that it takes a long time to get started from everything that i've heard. Like I know I'm a smart guy and all, but a lot of people spend a really long time figuring it out. I wonder if it's possible to use tim ferris's mantra of looking at the 20 percent. If I break it down into it's core priciples, then figure out what best resonates with me. There's a bunch of stuff with forex trading, options tradingm short selling, and even crupto, but I think it'd be best to go for stonks. I think the crypto market is so wild
