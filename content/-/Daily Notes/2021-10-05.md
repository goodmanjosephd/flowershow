## Journal
Good morning! I've been ppretty tired first thing in the morning. I had a bit o a struggle falling asleep last night because I took time to rest since I had a migraine. But I'm hanging in there!

- I like that I've been doing the daily journaling thing, but I almost wonder if I could improve upon it a little bit. How can I level up my journaling practice? I think a list of prompts could be useful. I think also really knowing what my goal is with it. I think it's reflection, to spend some time with myself to better feel my emotions, reflect on how I'm progressing, try to see any blind spots I may have, and create an action plan to move forward. I almost think it'd be nice to create a [[Journaling]] page

I just got this idea for a newsletter. Specifically one around
- How to take action on what we learn
	- julian post
	- taking time to distill content into action items. Understanding what content you consume is action oriented, and which is information oriented
		- then, a place for those action items to live. Notion database, experimentation journal, etc.
		- experimentation journal
			- its easier to tackle more things if you know when they'll be done
