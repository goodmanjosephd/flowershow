Good morning. I've been feeling a bit off lately. I don't know what to exactly describe this emotion. After looking at an emotion wheel, I feel all sorts of things, but its hard to pin point exactly. One of the things that really caught my attention was powerless. A couple others that made sense were withdrawn and dissapointed. All of those kinda make sense with what kinda goes on in my head. It's not like a fore front of my mind all of the time, but  a lot of the time I feel like " I really want to do something bigger with my life. I wish i was this, I should do that" then don't hold up those standards. There's so much that I want & need to do for work and for my own personal side hustle, but just haven't been able to commit to it. Every day that I'm not aligned with the person I really want to be, the shittier I feel about myself. 

So now what?

I want to start coaching myself instead of judging myself. 	I want to better set myself up for success. I think this will take form in part of setting a really good morning routine as my first mission. That will be my number one job tomorrow!



"Commit to one thing for a long time and you'll be successful"

Yeah, but what if you're not wired for that? You need to meet yourself on your own grounds
