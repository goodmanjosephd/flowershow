    - Good morning! Woke up a bit late and got a later start to the day, but all is well :D 
    - Things are going pretty smoothly with work this week. I did a really good job yesterday getting stuff done and sticking with my time blocking. I know usually for me, the first couple days are awesome, but then I have a hiccup and don't stick with it. This week, I'm just going to try to block it all out and try my best! Also, I think working with pomodoro timers would be nice too, just giving me little chunks to remind me to take breaks
