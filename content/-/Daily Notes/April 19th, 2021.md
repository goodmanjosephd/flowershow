- Journal ([[Morning Pages]] and [[Goal Review]])
    - Good morning! feeling a bit rough today. Feel stressed about work and about the things that I want to and have to do outside of work. Right now I'm working through an SEO audit that's super overdue but I've just had no motivation to do it. I procrastineated all weekend and now Im probnbabl going to get a message from the gig asking where it is. On top of that I haven't been happy with my progress at work. I really just want to get better all around but I feel like trash
    - 12:44 I'm feeling a bit better. I've watched some content today, I was able to deliver that SEO audit. I didn't make a whole lot of progress at work, but I was pretty distracted this morning. IO feel like work is a rat race that I"m never really getting ahead of. Which it's funny because I'm entirely in control of the situation. 
    - I was watching a video with Dr.K and pokimaine today, and thought it was interesting that her and I are struggling with very similar things. The main thing that struck me is the things that I "should be doing". One of my big questions that I've wanted to talk about at therapy is how to go from ideas in my head to action. But there's a larger question, one of, "why should I do that?" Also, the things that I'm doing are perfect as is. I'm perfect where I am. The pen on my desk is just vibing, existing in the universe, no right no wrong no expectations. I've felt serenity at moments where I'm in the city, not thinking about my expectations, but just enjoying the current moment. Enjoying what I'm doing and just vibing. This also feeds into measuring the gains vs the gap.
    - I'd really love to bring more serenity into my life. I'd love to start looking at the crossroads between the buddhism philosophies, as well as neuroscience and psychology. I think there's already something there with relying less on dopamine and more on serotonin. Serotonin is the here and now molecule that makes you feel good with where you're at. Dopamine is the molecule of expectation of reward. It's not actually achieving the thing, but our drive to expect that accomplishment. I'm not really explaining it the right way, but it's interesting to think about
    - another thing is that I want to share this stuff with the world. But right now, I'm not sure when the right time is to start. I think there's an aspect of starting before you're ready, but everything here is so based in quick facts, that I need to do more research and digging. I don't have a plan for money with this, but I really think it'd be fun to share this info with others, regardless of the monetary compensation. I just want to help others figure these things out too. Because where I'm at right now is not the best spot in the world, and I'm excited to get out of this little rut and start moving forward
    - I think it'd be awesome to provide this sort of coaching or therapy at scale. there's definitely a need for tradition therapy and psychiatry for people who have chronic issues, but I want to give more to people who are languishing. Just not happy with where they are in life. Privilged and have it good, but just aren't the happiest with who they are and what they're doing, maybe can't afford therapy, but feel like they're living in the passenger lane. 
        - What if there was like some sort of Choose Your Own Therapy, where people could click through videos based on what they were struggling with, to sort of create a personalized experience for themself, a self-guided thing.
