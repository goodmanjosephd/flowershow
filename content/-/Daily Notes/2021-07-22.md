Good morning! I really wanted to wake up a bit earlier this morning, but the bed had me pulled into its grasp. I did manage to get up at 745 and come out to journal for a little while, but of course then my computer took 10 minutes to update haha. That's okay though, because I'm here now! There was some stuff going through my head this morning, I think mainly that I wanted to map out all of the things I could work on and see what I'd enjoy the most. Hell, why not do all of them! Might as well make as much progress as I can on a wide variety of things, than to tell myself I need to focus on one thing but then not take any action on it because I want to do something else. It's quite silly actually
