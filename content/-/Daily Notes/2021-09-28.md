## Journal
good morning! Feeling a bit all over the place. I forgot about taking a look at jessie's website, but I think I just want to create a couple of title tags for him, then I can be pretty much done. Maybe also recommend creating a hub/spoke content model.

any ways, I haven't decided on next steps on my research to-do's, but I know that I need to finish my newsletter for tomorrow. That'll be a good step for today:) Then I just need to decide on fonts for nocturne, on top of continuing dopamine research. For the rest of this week, I'll need to decide on the next topic.
