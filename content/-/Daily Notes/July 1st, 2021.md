- Journal
    - Good morning! Yesterday I met with Jake and It was really awesome to talk through next steps for Automate Notion. He's going to start working on the recurring task build, while I''ll be working on the audience building. Speaking of which, I need to get working on some content! Today I'll organize my content ideas
    - Other than that I don't really know what to journal about today. I'm trying to get better with work, stay more on top of things. I keep reflecting my lack of doing things as a failure of willpower, which doesn't get me anywhere. Maybe over these next two days I could figure out 
    - I want to start publishing more. It doesn't have to be polished, it just needs to be about my journey. A public journal. I could have the category be 
- Ideas & Notes
    - We talk about this idea of "the person we want to become" yet it completely neglects the kind of person we are. We need to build in our own quirks and needs into that. If you want to be an early riser, but get your best work done at 2 am, then dig into that. Just because it's socially cool to wake up early doesn't mean that 
    - Why I stopped writing
        - I had two challenges
            - 30 days of blogging
            - 21 days of twitter threads
            - I enjoyed both of them
        - Then I was like " I want to take this to the next level"
        - But before, the goal was just to publish. Now, the goal is to create something useful.
            - I know what a "published post" looks like. I don't know what a useful post looks like
        - Now my subconcious is saying "I'd rather post something useful than post something almost useful", an issue of perfectionism.
        - Now, I recognize that and need to change the parameters. Now, I'll publish articles that I've previously outlined & edited. It's a step towards tangetializing the abstract.
        - Taking a step back, publishing more and learning what resonates with people will be more effective than sitting back and thinking about what makes an effective post. In order to get better, you need to practice.
        - You disservice the world more by keeping your voice hidden. even right now. An unhelpful post is more helpful than a non-helpful post. at least someone can hone their skills of knowing that it was a crap post. and you get practice
