## Journal
Good morning! Woke up a bit frightened today because of a nightmare I had but I'm okay now :) 

Feeling pretty alright this morning. I feel like my anxiety has gotten better over the past day or so, but I almost feel its like tasting of its lingering vibe still there. I wonder if it's because I'm a bit scared about the commitment I set up, and that I don't really know what to put in my newsletter. But I'm just going to commit to shipping my first few newsletters, and I'll worry about getting better later! 

As for Nocturne, I finished up the logo yesterday, and will now be working on solidifying fonts & colors!
