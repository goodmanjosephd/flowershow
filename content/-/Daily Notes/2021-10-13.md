## Journal
Good morning! Yesterday I didn't feel very nice. I felt bad because I spent a lot of time playing video games. I really want to see if I can start removing those high-dopamine sources. I think that would be a good latter half of the month challenge. Now that I've abstained from PMO for 2 whole weeks, it should start to get a little bit easier (relatively) to stop gaming for the rest of the month. Rather, How about if I only did it on the weekends? I think that constraint would be good because then I'd need to clear it with Ang, she'd know each time I'm going to do it, and if I do it too much, I think she'd get a little upset, so I have that natural limiter there. I''d still be able to play and work on my battle pass, try out the new character, etc. I just think that during the week it might be messing with my dopamine levels even more. 

Social media is something that's been pretty reflexive too, Something that I need to work on phasing out. But I'll focus on keeping tik tok uninstalled, as I get way too much dopamine from that 

Gotta send my newsletter this morning, which I'm actually pretty excited for! Hopefully I can get it done in a decent amount of time, and get some good feedback from Jessie too!
