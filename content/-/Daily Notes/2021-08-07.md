## Journal

Good morning & Happy saturday! I've been thinking more and more about the businesses that I want to build. I think going for the balance brewer thing would be really neat, and I have a little bit of money already saved up, to help start the business. I'd want to do it the right way, do a sole proprietorship and DBA. It'd cost a little money but I want to make this into an actual business. 

I think having these business ideas and letting myself free to pursue what I want has really helped with my motivation. Even if I just get a few sales a month, I think it'd be really neat! Though if I could make it into a business that gets me a full-time income, that'd be even better!
