## Journal
Good morning! I can't believe it's friday already. This week, almost everyday I've woken up at 7am. Granted what I do with that time hasn't been great yet, but I think I'm on the path to waking up earlier. Call me crazy, but I think it's been awesome to start off my day with something kinda difficult, that moves me towards my goals. Not necessarily difficult, but more unpleasant. Sacrificng my current wants to stay in bed for the greater goal of being able to wake up early so I have more time to work on my side projects.

I think I've made the decision to start with a newsletter. Yesterday I wanted to choose 3-5 topics to start on, then find sources for each of those. Rather, I think I should start from my sources. Is there a certain article that I find interesting that I can connect to other things I've learned? Also using my current atomic notes too. I think this'll be fun! It'll give me a good push to actually process my notes so I can come up with a topic each week. Another forcing function!
