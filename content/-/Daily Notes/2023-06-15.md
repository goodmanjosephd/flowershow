	- Taking a look at all of the reasons why
	- Why isn't where I am good enough?
	- What's the end goal
	- Selling dreams
		- I was buying into this idea that I could create a productized agancy, not do any work but make a bunch of money
	- It won't just "be better if" 
- efficency
	- tweaks vs leverage points
	- efficiency 
		- driving a car faster
