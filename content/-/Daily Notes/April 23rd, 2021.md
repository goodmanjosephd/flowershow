    - One thing I've been struggling with is just not being happy with the work that I'm doing. I feel like I continually compare myself with what I should be doing. I should be less distracted. I should work more on building my business. I should write more. I should read more. 
        - Honestly it's really frustrating. And the pit stays there, and keeps digging deeper. As I think about wanting to be better I feel worse and worse and it really sucks
        - I feel like I'm not putting any work in, so why even try?
        - If I identify as a piece of trash, then I'm going to act in accordance with that
    - I'm very fortunate to have the job that I do. It's an amazing opportunity

    - "write down 5 subconscious patterns that are running you" 
        - WOAH that's a tall order
        - I think there's something here though. Questioning the beliefs that you hold
            - Right now, I believe that I'm not a person who is good at taking action. But, when I've made a decision and have made my mind up about something, I go all in. I also see myself as an indecisive person. 
                - There's a deeper question of, are these bad things? Are these the right things to be concerned about? Am I asking the right questions. There's a deeper level!
                - Ex. I'm indecisive. Is that a bad thing? What does that mean? How has it affected my life? Why do I respond the way that I do? If the inputs changed, would I be "better"?
                - It's not always about finding "fixes" for your "issues", but asking better questions
                    - What if instead of asking how to be more productive, you analyzed why you're not being productive now. Is it because you don't enjoy what you're working on? Is it because you're not clear on what you need to do next? 
                        - You can even go a level deeper. Why should you be productive? Do you need to be?
