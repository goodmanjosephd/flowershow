## Journal
Good morning! 

Today I'm feelin pretty tired. Yesterday I published a newsletter that I was pretty proud of. That's all I can really hope for right now. I'm not too sure what my next steps will be for research, but I want to go back to the initial list I created, and I know that I had some "next to process" stuff. Haven't made any progress on biz stuff, but that's okay!
