Good morning! I actually woke up at a decent time this morning. I got up at 7:15ish and I've actually been feeling pretty good. For the past 15 minutes or so I've been processing notes from a healthy gamer clip about motivation. I've been distilling it into my own words, creating different headings for different ideas. and then I think I'm going to create all different LNs from each of those ideas! I'm feeling good about obsidian. I feel like I'm getting more actual work done on processing stuff than I was with roam. I'm not too sure why, but it's nice! Other than that, I still have to do some work on solidifying my workflow in obsidian, but I have plenty of stuff in my inbox already haha. 

Yesterday I was starting to think about my work. I think I've been making a point to exclude my work from my personal goal setting, but I think there's something I miss by doing that. I think that I need to include it so that way I can start working on how to be more effective with my work so that way I could work less hours. Then, I'd have more time during the day to build my business or personal brand. I think it's a direct correlation with optimizing work and

I'm actually pretty excited for work right now. I'm going to try my best to but in 4 focused hours of work and see how that goes!
