            - You're not responsible for your current state of circumstances. 
                - It was your past self sewing seeds for your future self
                - Blame them for it. Blame your parents. Don't get yourself down because your actions today aren't what you want them to be
            - So you're not responsible for your failures, that means you're also not responsible for your successes
            - All you can do is sew more seeds for your future self. Don't plant one seed and hope that it's going to grow. You'll starve. Instead, plant a bunch and see what grows
            - Detach your actions from your results
                - Keep your responsibility with your actions, not the results
        - Being down on myself for my actions
            - When I'm a part of a cohort, I follow through and I do the work
            - But when I'm on my own I don't 
            - I was good at school, that's all I knew. There were assignments, deadlines. 
            - Creating a business is a whole other game. I'm not good at it. People make it look easy but it isn't. I'm going up against a really large beast
            - I need to drop the expectations for myself
            - What's the negative feedback loop I have right now?
                - Idea for business
                - Set up website
                - Don't create anything
                - Say I suck at taking action
                - Reaffirm it
                - Fail at building business
