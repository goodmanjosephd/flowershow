In the podcast I was listening to yesterday, they were talking about "doing one thing really well" about "going all in" on a single thing. Cal Newport talks about this too. But every time this is brought up, it makes my stomach hurt. It's funny because I really idolize the people that have pursued a single craft for an extended period of time, but when I think about doing it myself it makes me want to vomit. But, maybe there is something there that I can exploit. Like anoother layer. deeper where the one thing to focus on can actually be spread to multiple parts of my life. Like a craftsperson focuses on a single trade, is there a single overarching theme that I can focus on, that gives me flexibility in my life? Like is there an angle or point of view I can take that stands out?
