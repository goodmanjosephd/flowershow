Today is a new day! I started my new way of obsidian, of having all of my notes in a single place! Is it a good idea? Dunno! Is it a good way to procrastinate? Absolutely!

I created my [[index]] page, but haven't added very much to it. I plan on trying to have that as a jumping off point for almost every note, either through some sort of map of content, or link of some sort. Every link in my vault should be accessible through that for people to eventually navigate through.

- Started reading [[Worry-Free Money]]
- Got 5 notes into the new "vault"
- Created [[Strategies to do things]]
